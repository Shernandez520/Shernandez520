# 👋 Hi, I'm Sheila  
**Automation Builder • Creative Technologist • AI-Powered Workflow Designer**

<p align="center">
  <strong>Building practical automations for real workflows — fast, clean, reliable.</strong>
</p>

I turn messy, repetitive processes into clean, scalable workflows — so teams can focus on meaningful work instead of manual steps.

With a background in production design and digital operations, I build lightweight automation tools that improve consistency, reduce bottlenecks, and save hours of manual effort. From PowerShell utilities to Adobe automation and no-code integrations, I create systems that are practical, fast, and reliable.
