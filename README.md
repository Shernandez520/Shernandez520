# 👋 Hi, I'm Sheila  
**Automation Builder • Creative Technologist • AI-Powered Workflow Designer**

<p align="center">
  <strong>Building practical automations for real workflows — fast, clean, reliable.</strong>
</p>

I turn messy, repetitive processes into clean, scalable workflows — so teams can focus on meaningful work instead of manual steps.

With a background in production design and digital operations, I build lightweight automation tools that improve consistency, reduce bottlenecks, and save teams hours of manual effort — especially across creative, marketing, and operations workflows.
