# 👋 Hi, I'm Sheila

I'm a creative problem-solver who automates the tedious so teams can focus on what matters.

With a background in production design and digital workflows, I build tools that streamline repetitive tasks, boost consistency, and save hours of manual work. From PowerShell scripts to Adobe automation, my projects are built for real-world speed and reliability.
